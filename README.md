🌐 Multi-Chain Subscription Payments with Anoma Intents

💡 Problem
Today paying subscriptions (like Netflix Spotify Saas on chain is hard
 Users must bridge tokens across chains  
 Handle manual swaps & gas fees 
 Payments often fail if balance is low

Solution
With Anoma Intents users only sign their goal once  

👉 I want to pay $10 USDC every month to this address from whichever chain I have liquidity  

Anoma s solver network automatically  
Finds the best route across chains  
Handles bridging swapping in the background  
Ensures the recipient always gets paid in stablecoins

How It Works User opens the frontend dApp prototype UI
Selects Set Subscription Payment  
Amount e.g. $10 USDC  Frequency e.g. every month  Recipient wallet address  
Signs an intent not a raw transaction  Solvers match the intent execute payments on the best chain  
Recipient receives stablecoins directly no matter the source chain

Prototype Frontend Idea
Simple dashboard  
Input fields for amount token frequency recipient  
Activate Subscription button  
Display active subscriptions  

  Future Use Cases
DAO payroll auto monthly salaries across chains
